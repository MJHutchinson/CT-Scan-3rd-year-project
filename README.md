# CT-Scan-3rd-year-project
A project centred around reconstructing images from ct scan data, turning this into a 3d model and manipulating the model

This project utilised a number of different reconstruction techniques to generate slice data, and then a 3d model of a scan of an action man figurine. This was then taken and rigged for animation and a short demo produced. Poses of the model were also 3d printed. For more details see [the final report](reports/CT_final_report.pdf)
